An implementation of two famous edge detectors
===================

## 1. Canny edge detector

#### Description

The Canny edge detector uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining how the technique works.

#### Steps Involved
- Apply Gaussian filter to smooth out the image
- Find intensity gradients from the given image
- Apply non-maximum suppression to remove spurious response to edge detection
- Apply double threshold to determine potential edges
- Track edge by hysteresis: finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges (not done)

#### Motivation

John Canny's paper on ["A Computational Approach to Edge Detection"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55e6/6333402df1a75664260501522800cf3d26b9.pdf).

#### Result

#### How to run
-------------

This program depends on the following packages:

 - Matplotlib
 - Skimage
 - NumPy
 - mpl_toolkits
 - argparse

Clone this repository with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adl1995/edge-detectors.git
```

Execute the script with:
```bash
python canny-edge.py --input <input image path> --output <output image path> --sigma <optional> --th1 <optional> --th2 <optional>
```

## 2. Marr Hildreth

#### Description

The Marr-Hildreth algorithm finds edges in digital images where there are strong and rapid variations in the image brightness. The Marrâ€“Hildreth edge detection method operates by convolving the image with the Laplacian of the Gaussian function, or, as a fast approximation by Difference of Gaussians (DoG). Then, zero crossings are detected in the filtered result to obtain the edges.

#### Steps Involved

- Apply Gaussian filter to smooth out the image
- Find zero crossings

#### Motivation

Hildreth's paper on ["Theory of edge detection"](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/bss/neuro/bornlab/qmbc/beta/day4/marr-hildreth-edge-prsl1980.pdf).
